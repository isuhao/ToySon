Simple UltraSonic MIDI controller (Arduino based toy)

This project is just example of using Arduino Nano and HS-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to build very simple MIDI controller.
Only two electronic components, some wires and PC (Windows prefered) are required to implement this project.
You can use this sketch as demo sample or to entertain yourself :)
