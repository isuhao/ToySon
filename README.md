# ToySon
Simple UltraSonic MIDI controller (Arduino based toy)

This project is just example of using Arduino Nano and HS-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to build very simple MIDI controller.
Only two electronic components, some wires and PC (Windows prefered) are required to implement this project.
You can use this sketch as demo sample or to entertain yourself :)

## Features

* Compatible with all types of  Arduino boards and clones
* Use Serial (over USB) to transmit MIDI messages to software synthesizer on PC
* Use HS-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to control pitch of notes (by hand or using direct TX-RX link)

## Getting Started

1. Use Arduino's Library Manager to install [Arduino MIDI Library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library)
2. Connect HS-SR04 properly (see [Guide](https://github.com/rnd64/ToySon/blob/master/ToySon%20Guide.pdf) )
3. Download [ToySon Sketch] (https://github.com/rnd64/ToySon/blob/master/Sketch/USMC.ino) to Arduino
4. Play!
